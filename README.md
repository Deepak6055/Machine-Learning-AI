# Machine-Learning-AI
This is a repository that contains different models of Machine Learning classified accordingly
This repository is a comprehensive collection of machine learning models, including but not limited to:

1. Supervised Learning Models: Classification, regression, and other supervised learning algorithms.
2. Unsupervised Learning Models: Clustering.
3. Deep Learning Models: Neural networks.
5. Natural Language Processing Models: NLP models for text processing and understanding.
6. Recommendation Systems: Collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation models(Apriori and Eclat).
   
The repository also includes example datasets, Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating these models.
